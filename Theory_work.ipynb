    "*Purpose*\n",
    "* The purpose of this project is to find out how popular the metal music genre is by analyzing data using a tool called Pandas. Pandas is a software library in Python that helps us manage and analyze data. By using Pandas to organize and examine this data, we can identify trends and understand how popular metal music is compared to other genres or over time. The goal is to use data to get a clear picture of metal's popularity.\n",

    "*Missing Data*\n",
    "* This analysis is necessary as it provides a clear picture of the change in intrests over time as musical society and how different types of songs have become more popular even though they share a genre with other songs. Disappointingly, I have not been able to find data to this scale from before the 2000's.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Stakeholders*\n",
    "* Benefactors of this information could be musicians looking to take their music to the next level, as well as people who have a keen interest in music.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Use*\n",
    "* The data can be used to track trends which allows professional musicians to suit their work to the current trends and helps music enjoyers find would be underground artists."
