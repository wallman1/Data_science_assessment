    "*Purpose*\n",
    "* The purpose of this project is to find out how popular the metal music genre is by analyzing data using a tool called Pandas. Pandas is a software library in Python that helps us manage and analyze data. By using Pandas to organize and examine this data, we can identify trends and understand how popular metal music is compared to other genres or over time. The goal is to use data to get a clear picture of metal's popularity.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Missing Data*\n",
    "* This analysis is necessary as it provides a clear picture of the change in intrests over time as musical society and how different types of songs have become more popular even though they share a genre with other songs. Disappointingly, I have not been able to find data to this scale from before the 2000's.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Stakeholders*\n",
    "* Benefactors of this information could be musicians looking to take their music to the next level, as well as people who have a keen interest in music.\n",

    "*Use*\n",
    "* The data can be used to track trends which allows professional musicians to suit their work to the current trends and helps music enjoyers find would be underground artists.\n",

    "* My data is being sourced form Kaggle, an online sharing website that shares datasets and raw information. The user that collected the data that I am using is responisble for ensuring that the data collected was gathered in an appropriate and legal manner, such as confirming artists consented and acknowledge that this data could be used in this manner, and the the owners of the songs listed can have their songs removed without question. Data that should be protected would include the names of the artists and the names of Spotify users listed as listeners of the songs listed.\n",
    "#\n",
    "*Application of Privacy*\n",
    "* My responsibility is extremely similar, ensuring that the data privacy rights of the artists of the songs are respected. If this program were to be publised to github or any other social site, I would need to respect the rights of the original creator of the data by crediting them as the original source and allowing them to have the data they collected removed form my program if they want.\n",

    "*Cyber Security*\n",
    "* A program that is open to the public should include at least one user authenification process.\n",

    "    * 2 Factor Authentification\n",

    "    * Encryption\n",
    "    * Password Hashing\n",
    "    * Web Application Firewalls\n",
    "* ***User Authentication***\n",
    "User authentication in computing is the process of verifying someone's identity when they try to access a computer system, website, or app. This is usually done by asking the person to enter a username and password. If the information matches what the system has on record, the person is allowed in. This process helps keep information safe by making sure only the right people can access certain parts of a system.\n",
    "* ***Password Hashing***\n",
    "Password hashing is a process in computing where a password is turned into a random-looking string of characters using a special algorithm. This makes it difficult for anyone to see or steal the original password. When you enter your password, the system hashes it and checks it against the stored hashed version. If they match, you get access. Hashing helps keep your password safe, even if someone gets hold of the stored data, because they can't easily reverse the hash to find out your actual password.\n",
    "* ***Encryption***\n",
    "Encryption in computing is the process of converting information or data into a secret code, so that only people with the correct key or password can read it. It’s like locking up your data in a safe, and only someone with the right key can open it and see what’s inside. This helps keep information secure from hackers or anyone who shouldn’t have access to it."
